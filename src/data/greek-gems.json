      "insight": "Paul uses ἀποκαλύπτω ('reveal') and ἀποκάλυψις ('revelation') repeatedly in Galatians 1:12-16. God chose to 'reveal' (ἀποκαλύψαι) His Son by 'revelation' (ἀποκαλύψεως). The repetition emphasizes: Paul's gospel isn't discovered but disclosed.",
      "whyEnglishMisses": "English uses 'reveal' and 'revelation' but the wordplay fades. Greek hammers the ἀπο-καλύπ- root: unveiling, unveiling, unveiling. Paul's gospel is God-disclosed, not self-discovered.",
