      "title": "Faith as Trust and Faithfulness",
      "summary": "Πίστις is one of the most theologically loaded terms in the NT. While often translated simply as 'faith' or 'belief,' it encompasses trust, confidence, faithfulness, and the content of what is believed. In Paul especially, it becomes the central term for humanity's proper response to God's grace.",
      "classicalGreek": "In classical Greek, πίστις primarily meant 'trust' or 'confidence' in persons or things. It could refer to the reliability that evokes trust, hence 'faithfulness' or 'trustworthiness.' In commercial contexts, it meant 'credit' or 'guarantee.' The verb πιστεύω meant 'to trust' or 'to believe someone.'",
      "lxxBackground": "The LXX uses πίστις to translate Hebrew אֱמוּנָה (ʾemunah), which fundamentally means 'firmness' or 'reliability.' In Habakkuk 2:4 ('the righteous shall live by his faith/faithfulness'), the term connects to covenant fidelity. The OT emphasis is on God's faithfulness (Deut 32:4) and the corresponding human response of trusting faithfulness.",
      "intertestamental": "In Second Temple Judaism, πίστις took on additional nuances. In 1 Maccabees, it often means 'loyalty' or 'fidelity.' In Philo, it becomes more philosophical - the highest virtue by which the soul clings to God. The Qumran community emphasized 'faith' as commitment to the community's interpretation of Torah.",
      "ntUsage": "Paul transforms πίστις into the central soteriological term. In Romans and Galatians, faith is set against works of the law as the means of justification (Rom 3:28; Gal 2:16). Yet it is never mere intellectual assent - it involves trust, commitment, and ongoing faithfulness. The 'obedience of faith' (Rom 1:5; 16:26) shows that genuine faith produces obedience. In Hebrews 11, πίστις is defined as 'the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen' - an active confidence that shapes life. James insists that faith without works is dead (Jas 2:17), emphasizing that genuine πίστις necessarily produces action.",

      "theologicalSignificance": "Πίστις in the NT represents humanity's proper response to God's self-revelation in Christ. It is the empty hand that receives grace, yet it is never passive - genuine faith transforms life and produces obedience. The Reformers rightly emphasized that we are justified by faith alone (sola fide), but this faith is never alone - it works through love (Gal 5:6). Faith unites the believer to Christ, so that His righteousness becomes ours. In this sense, faith is not a meritorious work but the God-given means by which we receive Christ and all His benefits.",

      "summary": "Δικαιοσύνη is the NT term for righteousness or justice. In Paul, 'the righteousness of God' (δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ) becomes the heart of the gospel - both God's own righteous character and the right standing He gives to believers through Christ.",
      "classicalGreek": "In classical Greek, δικαιοσύνη was the cardinal virtue of giving to each their due. For Plato, it was the harmony of the soul's parts; for Aristotle, the virtue of proper social relations. It encompassed legal justice, fairness, and moral rectitude.",
      "lxxBackground": "The LXX uses δικαιοσύνη primarily for צְדָקָה (tsedaqah), which in Hebrew thought is essentially relational - right standing within the covenant. God's righteousness is His faithfulness to His covenant promises and His saving action on behalf of His people (Ps 98:2; Isa 46:13). Human righteousness is covenant faithfulness.",
      "intertestamental": "In Second Temple Judaism, righteousness became increasingly associated with Torah observance. The Qumran community spoke of 'the Teacher of Righteousness' and emphasized righteous living according to their strict interpretation. 4 Ezra struggles with how humans can be righteous before a holy God.",
      "ntUsage": "Paul's doctrine of righteousness revolutionizes the concept. In Romans 1:17, 'the righteousness of God' is revealed in the gospel - not primarily as a condemning standard but as a saving gift. Romans 3:21-26 explains that God demonstrates His righteousness by justifying sinners through Christ's atoning sacrifice. This righteousness is received 'by faith' (Rom 3:22) and 'apart from law' (Rom 3:21). The result is that believers are 'declared righteous' (justified) - they receive a right standing with God not based on their own works but on Christ's perfect obedience. Yet this forensic declaration leads to actual righteousness of life (Rom 6:13, 18).",

This righteousness is forensic (a legal declaration) but not fictional - it is grounded in Christ's actual obedience and creates real transformation. The Reformation recovered this truth: sinners are justified not by infused righteousness but by Christ's righteousness imputed to them through faith.

The Graces (Χάριτες) were goddesses of charm and beauty. The term implied reciprocity - favor given expected favor returned.",
      "lxxBackground": "The LXX uses χάρις primarily for Hebrew חֵן (chen), meaning 'favor' or 'grace.' It describes finding favor in someone's eyes (Gen 6:8; 18:3).

The OT emphasis is on God's gracious initiative in choosing and redeeming Israel despite their unworthiness.",
      "intertestamental": "Sirach uses χάρις extensively for divine favor and human gratitude. The Qumran Hodayot (thanksgiving hymns) emphasize that salvation is entirely by God's grace. 4 Ezra wrestles with whether God's grace or human merit determines salvation. These texts show the tension that Paul's gospel would resolve.",
      "ntUsage": "Paul makes χάρις the central category for understanding salvation. Grace is God's favor shown to sinners who deserve only wrath (Rom 3:24; Eph 2:8-9). It is the opposite of works - if by grace, then not by works (Rom 11:6). Yet grace is not merely an attitude but a power that reigns (Rom 5:21), teaches believers to live godly (Titus 2:11-12), and is sufficient for every need (2 Cor 12:9). Believers stand in grace (Rom 5:2), grow in grace (2 Pet 3:18), and must not receive it in vain (2 Cor 6:1). The gospel itself is called 'the gospel of the grace of God' (Acts 20:24).",

The Spirit witnesses to Christ (John 15:26), teaches truth (John 16:13), and enables believers to cry 'Abba, Father' (Rom 8:15).

Paul especially develops sin as a power that enslaves humanity.",
      "classicalGreek": "In classical Greek, ἁμαρτάνω meant 'to miss' (a target), 'to fail,' or 'to make a mistake.' It could describe any failure to achieve a goal, including intellectual error. The word did not carry heavy moral or religious weight - it was more about failure than guilt.",
      "lxxBackground": "The LXX uses ἁμαρτία primarily for חַטָּאת (chattat), which covers the whole range of sinful acts and states. The OT presents sin as transgression of God's law (Lev 4-5), rebellion against God's authority (Isa 1:2), and violation of the covenant relationship. Sin brings guilt, defilement, and requires atonement through sacrifice.",

The Qumran texts emphasize ritual and moral purity, with detailed rules to avoid defilement. There is growing sense that sin is a cosmic problem requiring divine solution.",
      "ntUsage": "Paul radicalizes the doctrine of sin. In Romans 1-3, he demonstrates that all - Gentile and Jew - are 'under sin' (Rom 3:9). Sin is not just individual acts but a power that entered the world through Adam (Rom 5:12), reigns over humanity (Rom 5:21; 6:12), enslaves (Rom 6:6, 17, 20), and brings death (Rom 6:23). The law, unable to save, actually increases sin's trespass (Rom 5:20; 7:7-13). Only Christ's death can deal with sin's power (Rom 8:3).

      "classicalGreek": "In classical Greek, σωτηρία meant 'deliverance,' 'preservation,' or 'safety' - often from physical danger like battle, shipwreck, or disease. The σωτήρ (savior) was one who rescued from peril. The word had religious overtones when applied to gods who delivered worshipers, and political overtones when applied to rulers who saved their people.",
      "lxxBackground": "The LXX uses σωτηρία for יְשׁוּעָה (yeshu'ah) and related words. God is Israel's salvation (Exod 15:2; Ps 27:1). He saves from enemies, exile, and death. The name 'Jesus' (Ἰησοῦς) derives from this root - 'YHWH saves.' Isaiah especially develops salvation eschatologically: God will bring final deliverance, gathering His people and establishing justice (Isa 52:7-10).",
      "intertestamental": "Second Temple texts continue the theme of divine deliverance. The Psalms of Solomon pray for God's salvation through the Messiah. Qumran looked for eschatological salvation through God's decisive intervention. There is increasing focus on salvation from sin and its consequences, not just physical enemies.",

Salvation encompasses forgiveness (Acts 2:38), reconciliation (Rom 5:10), redemption (Eph 1:7), and eternal life (John 3:16). It is by grace through faith (Eph 2:8-9), not by works. Believers are saved (past - Eph 2:8), being saved (present - 1 Cor 1:18), and will be saved (future - Rom 5:9-10). The full scope of salvation awaits Christ's return (Rom 13:11; Heb 9:28).",

Yet salvation transforms - those saved from sin's penalty are being saved from sin's power and will be saved from sin's presence.

It could also mean 'removal' or 'destruction' (causing something to rise and depart). The concept of resurrection from death was foreign to mainstream Greek thought, which viewed the soul's immortality as desirable escape from the body.",

Daniel 12:2 promises that many sleeping in the dust will awake - some to everlasting life, others to shame. Isaiah 26:19 envisions the dead living, bodies rising. The hope for resurrection emerges especially in response to martyrdom (2 Macc 7).",

The Qumran community apparently believed in resurrection. 2 Maccabees 7 powerfully expresses hope in resurrection for martyrs. 1 Enoch and other apocalyptic texts elaborate resurrection scenarios. Jewish resurrection hope was for bodily, not merely spiritual, existence.",

The resurrection body is not a ghost but transformed physicality - continuous with yet gloriously different from our present bodies. Without resurrection, faith is futile (1 Cor 15:14, 17).

This nuance shapes NT usage: God's covenant is His sovereign disposition, not a negotiated contract.",

Jeremiah 31:31-34 promises a 'new covenant' - not like Sinai, but with the law written on hearts and sins forgiven. This prophecy is foundational for NT covenant theology.",

Hebrews develops covenant theology most fully: Jesus is mediator of a 'better covenant' based on better promises (Heb 8:6), established by His blood (Heb 9:15-22). The old covenant is 'obsolete' (Heb 8:13), replaced by the new. Paul contrasts the ministry of the old covenant (letter, death, condemnation) with the new (Spirit, life, righteousness - 2 Cor 3).

(2) Human nature/existence - the Word became flesh (John 1:14); Christ came in the flesh (1 Tim 3:16). (3) Human weakness and mortality (Gal 2:20: 'the life I now live in the flesh'). (4) The sinful nature in opposition to the Spirit (Gal 5:16-17; Rom 8:5-8). This last usage is distinctively Pauline: the flesh produces sin's works and is hostile to God.

Believers have crucified the flesh (Gal 5:24) but still war against it. Victory comes not by self-effort (which is itself 'fleshly') but by the Spirit.

      "classicalGreek": "In classical Greek, ἀπολύτρωσις referred to the release of prisoners or slaves through ransom payment (λύτρον). A captive's freedom was purchased at a price. The word group conveyed deliverance through the expenditure of resources - liberation that cost something.",
      "lxxBackground": "The OT background is crucial. God 'redeemed' Israel from Egyptian slavery (Exod 6:6; Deut 7:8). The גָּאַל (ga'al) system allowed the kinsman-redeemer to purchase back a relative sold into slavery (Lev 25:47-49). The פָּדָה (padah) system involved ransoming the firstborn (Exod 13:13). Israel's identity as redeemed people shapes their relationship with God.",
      "intertestamental": "Expectations grew for a future redemption greater than the Exodus. God would redeem Israel from exile and oppression. The Psalms of Solomon (8:33; 9:1) pray for this redemption. Some texts spiritualize redemption as liberation from sin, not just foreign powers.",
      "ntUsage": "The NT announces that God's redemption has come in Christ. Believers have 'redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins' (Eph 1:7; Col 1:14). Christ gave Himself as a 'ransom for all' (1 Tim 2:6). We are 'bought with a price' (1 Cor 6:20; 7:23). Redemption is past (accomplished at the cross), present (applied in Christian experience), and future ('the redemption of our bodies' - Rom 8:23).

Through redemption - a price paid, justice satisfied, slaves set free. The question of 'to whom the ransom is paid' may press the metaphor too far, but the point is clear: our liberation required costly sacrifice. Redemption creates obligation: we belong to the One who bought us and should glorify Him (1 Cor 6:20).",

This may mean Christ is the antitype of the OT mercy seat - the true meeting place between God and sinners - or that His death is the ultimate propitiatory sacrifice.

The anointed king was the 'Lord's anointed' (χριστὸς κυρίου, 1 Sam 24:6). The term developed messianic associations through prophetic promises (Ps 2:2; Isa 61:1; Dan 9:25-26).",
      "intertestamental": "Messianic expectation intensified. Psalms of Solomon 17-18 describe a coming Davidic king, the 'Lord's Anointed.' Qumran expected multiple 'messiahs' - priestly and royal. Various messianic figures arose claiming the title. By the first century, 'Messiah' carried strong nationalistic and royal expectations.",
      "ntUsage": "Jesus is identified as the Christ (Matt 16:16; John 1:41). He is anointed with the Spirit at baptism (Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38). Yet He redefines messiahship through suffering (Mark 8:29-31). 'Christ' becomes so closely identified with Jesus that it functions as a name: 'Jesus Christ' or 'Christ Jesus.' Paul uses 'Christ' 383 times, often in phrases like 'in Christ,' 'with Christ,' 'through Christ.' The death and resurrection of Christ become the center of the gospel (1 Cor 15:3-4).",

Colossians 1:15-16 affirms Christ as the agent of creation: 'by Him all things were created' (ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη τὰ πάντα). 2 Corinthians 5:17 and Galatians 6:15 declare believers a 'new creation' (καινὴ κτίσις) - regeneration as new creative act.

It names the final book of Scripture ('Revelation') and expresses the Christian conviction that God has revealed Himself and His purposes in Christ. The eschatological 'apocalypse' of Christ is both past (His first coming) and future (His return).",
      "classicalGreek": "In classical Greek, ἀποκάλυψις (from ἀπό 'from' + καλύπτω 'to cover') simply meant 'uncovering' or 'disclosure.' It was used literally for removing a covering and metaphorically for revealing secrets or making known what was hidden. The term had no special religious significance in pagan Greek.",
      "lxxBackground": "The LXX uses ἀποκαλύπτω occasionally for גָּלָה (galah) - to uncover, reveal. God reveals secrets (Dan 2:19, 22, 28-29). The 'arm of the Lord' is revealed (Isa 52:10; 53:1). Divine revelation comes through prophets: 'The Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets' (Amos 3:7). The apocalyptic tradition (Daniel, Ezekiel) provides visions of heavenly realities and future events.",
      "intertestamental": "The apocalyptic literature (1 Enoch, 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, etc.) developed the 'revelation' concept extensively. Heavenly secrets are revealed to chosen seers through visions and angelic interpreters. Hidden wisdom about cosmic battles, future judgment, and coming salvation is 'unveiled' to the faithful. This genre gave rise to the term 'apocalyptic' - literature revealing end-time mysteries.",
      "ntUsage": "Revelation 1:1 opens: 'The revelation (ἀποκάλυψις) of Jesus Christ' - both revelation from Christ and about Christ. Paul speaks of 'revelation' as the mode of receiving the gospel (Gal 1:12) and understanding mystery (Eph 3:3). The coming of Christ is His 'revelation' (ἀποκάλυψις, 1 Cor 1:7; 2 Thess 1:7; 1 Pet 1:7, 13). Present suffering prepares for 'the glory about to be revealed' (Rom 8:18). The 'sons of God' await their 'revelation' (Rom 8:19). Divine wrath is 'revealed' (Rom 1:18) as is righteousness (Rom 1:17).

Revelation involves both disclosure and response - what God unveils must be received by faith.

      "intertestamental": "In Second Temple Judaism, the 'two or three witnesses' requirement (Deut 19:15) was carefully applied. The Qumran community regulated testimony in their courts. Martyrdom theology developed - faithful witnesses to Torah sometimes died rather than compromise, becoming 'martyrs' in the later sense.",

Christ's resurrection vindicates His claims, demonstrates His deity, conquers death, and guarantees our resurrection. The resurrection is historical - it happened in space and time - yet also eschatological - it inaugurates the new creation. Believers already share in resurrection life spiritually (Eph 2:5-6) and will share bodily at Christ's return. The resurrection body is not resuscitated flesh but transformed, glorified, immortal (1 Cor 15:42-54). Resurrection affirms the body's goodness - God redeems, not abandons, His material creation. Easter is not an appendix to Good Friday but its vindication and completion.",

John the Baptist, Jesus, and the apostles all preach: 'Repent!' It is the human response to God's grace, inseparable from faith.",
      "classicalGreek": "In classical Greek, μετάνοια meant afterthought, change of mind, or regret. It could indicate reconsideration of a decision or remorse over past action. The emphasis was cognitive - changing one's thinking. It did not carry the strong moral and religious weight it gains in biblical usage.",
      "lxxBackground": "The LXX uses μετανοέω occasionally, but more often uses ἐπιστρέφω (to turn) for Hebrew שׁוּב (shuv) - the primary OT term for repentance. Prophetic preaching calls Israel to 'return' to God (Jer 3:12; Hos 14:1; Joel 2:12-13). Repentance involves turning from sin and turning to God. It is both gift and demand, enabled by God yet commanded of humans (Ezek 18:30-32).",
      "intertestamental": "Second Temple Judaism emphasized repentance as the path back to God. The Qumran community called for radical repentance and separation from sinners. Rabbinic literature extensively discussed repentance (teshuvah). Some texts speak of God's patience giving opportunity for repentance. John the Baptist's call to repentance (Matt 3:2) stood in this tradition yet announced something new - the kingdom was at hand.",
      "ntUsage": "John the Baptist preaches 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand' (Matt 3:2). Jesus begins His ministry with the same call (Matt 4:17; Mark 1:15). Repentance is essential for forgiveness (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31). Paul preached 'repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ' (Acts 20:21). God's kindness leads to repentance (Rom 2:4). God grants repentance (Acts 11:18; 2 Tim 2:25) - it is His gift. Yet humans are commanded to repent (Acts 17:30). Repentance produces fruit (Matt 3:8; Acts 26:20) - changed behavior demonstrates genuine change of heart. There is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents (Luke 15:7, 10).",

It involves mind (new understanding), emotions (godly sorrow), and will (changed direction). Repentance is inseparable from faith - two sides of one coin, as turning from sin is turning to Christ. Though commanded, repentance is ultimately God's gift (Acts 11:18) - only His grace enables genuine change. Repentance is not merely initial conversion but ongoing posture: believers continually turn from sin. The Reformation recovered repentance's centrality: Luther's first thesis declared 'the whole life of believers should be repentance.'",
